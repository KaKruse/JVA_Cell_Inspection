2.1 Replace each cell that occures more then 10 times with a new random number between 0..27 till no cell occures more than 10 times.
3. Check if numbers between 0 and 27 are not in the list of the 40 random numbers
3.1 For each number which is not in the list replace one random number which is more than 1 time in the list with the new number.
4. Put all 40 random numbers into 4 number slices and store them with a date
